#+title: The Great Denpa Men QR Investigation

** Reading

*** DONE DPM1
- Will *only* read v6 lM
*** DONE DPM2-3
- The games pulls garbage data when a field is missing or invalid
- They do not care what format the QR is in as long as the data is valid.
- Despite the QRs having different headers by region, they can be cross-read.
  If a denpa exists in your house, and you scan a QR from a different region
  but with same parameters, the game will acknowledge that.
  If that is not the case, it will just error for incompatibility.

** Writing
*** TODO DPM1
- Some sort of time-based encryption is applied to the QR.
*** TODO DPM2
#+caption: - red's the header
#+caption: - blue's a separator used for unknown purposes,
#+caption: - green is some sort of data,
#+caption: - orange i believe to be the head, which is a really weird feature to highlight but it's the first that jumped at me

- Encoding is much more linear and deterministic.
- QRs are formatted almost readably
**** WEST
DPM2 EU and NA qrs have the same header but different offsets
the first eight bytes are ~8C78 C533 CB2C 8DE6~
bytes 10 to 2f have the same values in all regions:
~302A 039B C089 3DC6 302A 039B C089 3DC6~
~302A 039B C089 3DC6 302A 039B C089 3DC6~
same goes for 70-77
40-6f are some data
***** US
39-3f have a value of ~0b5c 5565 5a58 43af~
**** JAPAN
japanese DPM2 qrs start with ~952d 41c1 a1dd 7f2c~
